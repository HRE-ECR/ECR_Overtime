# OvertimeHub v3.6.3 (Backup)

This is a backup package of the v3.6.3 project with `.eslintrc.cjs` included.

## Why `.eslintrc.cjs` matters
It configures ESLint (developer linting). It does not affect runtime unless `npm run lint` is executed.

## Supabase
Run `supabase/schema.sql` in Supabase SQL editor.
